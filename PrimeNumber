/* PRIME NUMBER
 * It is a number which is divisible by 1 and Itself
 * 1st we input a number
 * Here we take a for loop which starts from 2 and ends with (number-1)
 * The number is then divided by each value of "i" inside for loop
 * If the number gets divided by any of value of "i"
 * That means that number is not a Prime Number
