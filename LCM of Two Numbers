/* Lowest Common "Multiple"
 * A multiple is a number which you get when you ultiply a number by a whole number (greater than 0)
 * The least common multiple of two numbers is the “smallest non-zero common number” which is a multiple of both the numbers.
 * example:- (4 and 8)....lcm of 2 are(2,4) and lcm of 4 are(2,4,8)....common are (2,4).....the lowest between them is 2
 
 * WE DONT CONSIDER 0 as multiple.... as 0 multiplied by any number will give 0
 
 * If you dont find any common multiple, then return multiplication of both the number
 * example:- (4 and 8)....lcm of 2 are(2,4) and lcm of 4 are(2,4,8)....common are (2,4).....the lowest between them is 2
 * example:- (4 and 5)....lcm of 4 are (2,4) and lcm of 5 are (5)......No Common between them.......return (4*5)=20  as you are to return common multiple
 
 * Find multiple byt dividing that number
